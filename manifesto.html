                      To possess knowledge is to have a critical consciousness of one's own
                      socio-cultural reality. Paulo Freire in his book, <i>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</i>,
                      notes that our objective social reality cannot be separated from a critical
                      intervention of our said history. Considering this, knowledge presents
                      itself as an understanding of our collective socio-cultural realities;
                      including, but certainly not limited to, historical, visual, and media
                      literacy. This possession of knowledge, as Freire puts it, leads one to
                      <i>critically intervene in their </i> own reality and allows us to think about how
                      our past informs our present, and potential futures.

                      History as an apparatus, is being misused for a Hindu nationalist mythos to
                      establish itself. Hindu nationalism- a conservative social and political
                      ideology is rooted in the idea of India as a homogenized Hindu national
                      majority. Such an ideology maintains itself through cultural hegemony,
                      laying unjust and false claims to history, and spreading dangerous communal
                      rhetoric. We have witnessed a rapid public altering of history, whether that
                      is ‘Hinduising’ names of historical cities, or rewriting history in school
                      textbooks; to erase the roles and contributions of Mughal rule, and the
                      reality of gender violence and caste discrimination. Our artistic and
                      journalistic freedom of expression is curtailed through excessive
                      censorship. Journalists, academics, and activists have been murdered, deemed

                      lens. <i>Remix</i> seeks to revisit and retell, to rupture an <a href="#sixteen" aria-describedby="footnote-label" id="sixteen-ref">
                    archive</a>  predicated
                      on dominant myths, and challenge the gaps and silences through the exercise
                      of imagining. To <i>remix</i> means for the past to meet the present: to speculate
                      on the lost and untold, and imagine potential futures of what the present
                      will look like as history.

                              suggests many avenues: “advancing a series of speculative arguments”,
                              “exploiting the capacities of the subjunctive (a grammatical mood that
                              expresses doubts, wishes, and possibilities)”, writing history “with and
                              against the archive,” “imagining what cannot be verified”.

                              he discerns in Aunt Hester’s screams transformed into the songs of the Great

                              “acuity of regard. '' which arises from a willingness to look into the open
